## 🚀 Project Overview

ISTRedMap analyzes traffic accident data from Istanbul and visualizes it on a map. Using clustering algorithms and other spatial insights, it helps identify critical locations with high accident density. The aim is to contribute to public awareness and traffic safety analysis.

## 📊 Features

- Interactive heatmap of accident locations
- Dangerous zones highlighted using clustering (KMeans)
- Hover-based tooltips with accident metadata
- Color-coded legend for clarity
- Reduced data sampling for performance
- Modularized structure (`main.py`, `map.py`, etc.)
